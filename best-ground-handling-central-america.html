                        In aviation, “best” is not a slogan—it is the ability to keep every operation safe, on time, and effortless for passengers and crews. 
                        With ISAGO and IATA recognition, strong ties to BAA and NBAA, over 10 million passengers handled, and more than 150 clients across 
                        five countries, Aerojet has become the benchmark for ground handling in Central America.

                        <h2>What “Best” Really Means in Ground Handling</h2>
                        <p>
                            Ground handling is the invisible engine of aviation. Long before a passenger walks up to the gate—or a cargo door opens on the ramp—teams are 
                            already coordinating permits, fuel, crew logistics, GSE, safety checks, and timing down to the minute. When it works, nobody notices. 
                            When it fails, everyone does.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Aerojet was built to make sure airlines, private operators, and cargo customers never have to worry about what happens on the ground. 
                            From touchdown to takeoff, we manage every step of the operation: passenger services, ramp, cargo, logistics, AVSEC, permits, and 
                            line maintenance, all under one regional umbrella.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Being “the best” in this environment means three things: <strong>uncompromising safety</strong>, 
                            <strong>predictable on-time performance</strong>, and a <strong>service culture</strong> that treats every aircraft as a VIP movement—whether it carries 
                            one passenger or hundreds of them.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In aviation, trust must be earned and then documented. Aerojet’s operations are aligned with the strictest international standards, 
                            reflected in global certifications and memberships that matter to airlines, business jet operators, and regulators alike.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through IATA and ISAGO standards, Aerojet follows globally recognized procedures for ramp, passenger, and cargo handling. 
                            These frameworks formalize what our teams practice daily: robust safety management systems, audited processes, and continuous 
                            improvement in training and supervision.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For business and private aviation, our participation in networks such as <strong>BAA</strong> (Business Aviation Association) and 
                            <strong>NBAA</strong> (National Business Aviation Association) connects Aerojet with best practices, trends, and expectations from leading 
                            operators worldwide. It means that when a corporate flight or VIP charter lands in Central America, its crew finds procedures, 
                            service levels, and safety culture aligned with what they expect at top-tier FBOs around the globe.

                        <p>
                            Numbers alone do not make a company great—but they do prove that the formula works. Aerojet has handled 
                            <strong>over 10 million passengers</strong> and supports <strong>more than 150 clients</strong>, from major commercial airlines and global cargo operators 
                            to boutique charter companies and government flights.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This volume has taught us how to manage peak seasons, irregular operations, and complex multi-leg itineraries without compromising 
                            on safety or care. Our teams are trained to move fast while keeping passengers, crew, and cargo secure and informed at every stage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Operating across <strong>Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Panama</strong>, Aerojet gives operators a single, trusted partner for 
                            the entire Central American region. Whether it’s a new route, a seasonal charter program, a once-off sports charter, or a time-sensitive 
                            cargo mission, clients don’t need to rebuild trust at each station—they bring Aerojet with them.

                            What truly differentiates Aerojet is our ability to handle <strong>three aviation segments under one roof</strong>: private/executive flights, cargo

                            from the same safety culture, training standards, and regional coordination.

                            For private flights, we deliver VIP meet &amp; greet, concierge, ground transportation, and meticulous ramp handling designed for discretion 
                            and speed. For cargo, we manage everything from perishables and pharmaceuticals to oversized freight and express shipments, ensuring 
                            compliance and protection at every touchpoint. For commercial airlines, our passenger, ramp, and flight operations teams keep schedules

                        <h2>Leading Sustainability on the Ramp in Central America</h2>
                        <p>
                            Being the best also means taking responsibility for the future of aviation. Aerojet has invested heavily in <strong>electric ground support 
                            equipment</strong> and clean-energy infrastructure, becoming one of the regional pioneers of greener ground handling.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By introducing electric loaders, tractors, and towbarless technology, Aerojet has dramatically reduced emissions associated with towing, 
                            loading, and ramp movements. In cargo operations, these changes have contributed to an estimated 50% reduction in the carbon footprint 
                            of day-to-day ground activities, all while maintaining or improving turnaround efficiency.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sustainability is not treated as a side project; it is integrated into how we plan investments, choose equipment, and design procedures. 
                            For clients, that means their operations in Central America can align with global ESG goals without sacrificing performance or reliability.

                        <h2>A People-First Safety Culture</h2>
                        <p>
                            Safety in ground handling does not start with manuals; it starts with people. Aerojet understands that a motivated, rested, and respected 
                            team is the strongest safety barrier an airline or operator can have. That’s why we invest in occupational health, mental wellbeing, and 
                            structured fatigue management across our stations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our Occupational Health Department and fatigue management programs are designed to reduce the risk of human error during long shifts, 
                            night operations, and peak traffic periods. Data-driven insights help us plan rosters, breaks, and staffing levels so that teams can perform 
                            at their best when the ramp is at its busiest.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Recognition and open communication are part of daily life at Aerojet. Programs such as “Employee of the Month” and “Above and Beyond” 
                            distinctions celebrate those who go the extra mile for safety and service. An open-door policy allows anyone—from ramp agents to managers—
                            to raise concerns, share ideas, or flag potential hazards without fear.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The result is a culture where people feel valued, speak up early, and protect one another. That human factor is a big part of why airlines, 
                            cargo operators, and private flight departments trust Aerojet with their most critical ground operations.
