                <h2 class="mb-3">Behind the scenes of 24/7 cargo operations</h2>
                <p>
                    For shippers and airlines, a cargo flight is a schedule and a tracking number. For Aerojet, it is a chain of precise actions that begins long before the aircraft lands and ends only when every pallet or box is safely on its way to the final destination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hours before arrival, Aerojet’s operations desk receives pre-alerts with AWBs, cargo manifests and special handling instructions. Teams validate regulatory requirements, coordinate with customs, schedule ground support equipment (GSE), and align ramp crews so that the aircraft can be turned around quickly and safely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because cargo aviation in Central America is highly time-sensitive — especially for fresh produce, pharmaceuticals and express shipments — Aerojet designs its processes around speed without compromising safety or traceability. That is what allows the operation to truly run 24/7.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mb-3">Ground and ramp services: from touchdown to takeoff</h2>
                <p>
                    Once the aircraft arrives on stand, ground and ramp handling become the center of the operation. Aerojet’s teams marshal the aircraft, position chocks, connect GPU or ASU if needed, and start the unloading plan that was agreed with the airline or cargo operator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Specialized equipment such as loaders, belt loaders, tractors and dollies are coordinated to keep cargo flowing continuously from aircraft to warehouse. Every movement is supervised by ramp coordinators who manage safety zones, communication with the cockpit, and adherence to both IATA and local airport procedures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On departure, the process reverses: pallets and ULDs are loaded following the weight and balance plan, security seals are checked, doors are closed and ground equipment is removed in the correct sequence. The goal is always the same — a safe, on-time turnaround that protects the integrity of each shipment.

                <h2 class="mb-3">Customs, documentation and regulatory compliance</h2>
                <p>
                    Even the fastest ramp operation can be delayed by incomplete paperwork. That is why Aerojet’s cargo teams place so much emphasis on documentation, customs processes and regulatory coordination in every country where they operate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to arrival, documents such as airway bills, manifests, permits and special approvals are reviewed to flag any gaps. During the operation, Aerojet acts as a bridge between airlines, freight forwarders, customs brokers and authorities, helping ensure that cargo flows through the system with minimal friction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For exports, the focus shifts to ensuring that all declarations, inspections and security checks are completed in time to load cargo safely. For imports and transit cargo, Aerojet works closely with partners to avoid unnecessary storage, fines or delays linked to non-compliance.

                <h2 class="mb-3">Cold chain, special cargo and security</h2>
                <p>
                    Not all cargo is created equal. Fresh produce, pharmaceuticals, live animals, dangerous goods and high-value shipments demand an extra layer of attention and infrastructure. Aerojet designs its procedures to keep these flows under strict control from the moment they arrive at the airport.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cold chain cargo requires temperature-controlled handling and fast transfer to refrigerated areas or vehicles. Pharma shipments, for example, must maintain stability throughout their journey, so timing and data are critical. Aerojet teams are trained to read and respect these requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Security is another non-negotiable element. Working in line with AVSEC standards and local regulations, Aerojet coordinates screening, seal checks and secure storage for sensitive or high-value cargo, reducing the risk of tampering or loss along the way.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Temperature-sensitive cargo handling and rapid transfer</li>

                <h2 class="mb-3">People, technology and sustainability in cargo handling</h2>
                <p>
                    Around-the-clock operations only work when the people behind them are trained, supported and protected. Aerojet invests heavily in continuous training, safety culture and wellbeing programs so that ramp agents, coordinators and dispatchers can perform at their best during night shifts and peak seasons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technology also plays a key role: centralized communication channels, digital checklists, real-time coordination with airline control centers, and standardized SOPs ensure that every turn follows the same high standard, regardless of airport or aircraft type.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sustainability has become another strategic pillar. By incorporating electric loaders, tractors and towbarless equipment where possible, Aerojet significantly reduces the carbon footprint of cargo operations while also lowering noise and improving conditions on the ramp.

                <h2 class="mb-3">Why a regional partner matters for your cargo strategy</h2>
                <p>
                    Many cargo operators today think regionally rather than airport by airport. Central America is a network, and having a single partner who understands the operational, regulatory and cultural nuances of each station can be a decisive advantage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aerojet supports operations in key hubs such as San José (MROC), Liberia (LIR) and other strategic airports across Costa Rica, as well as stations in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Panama through its group network. This allows airlines and logistics companies to scale quickly while keeping a consistent level of service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you are launching a new cargo route, operating ad-hoc charters or consolidating your presence in the region, having Aerojet on the ground means having a team focused on safety, punctuality and the success of your cargo strategy 24/7.
